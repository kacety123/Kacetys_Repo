This Primary Repo will host the main web application that goes over who I am, both personally and professionally. 

It will begin basic, and will grow in time as I find the time and the inspiration to make changes. Links will be added in the links drop down menu for either repo's hosting example work or for sites similar to the one created here for example of my capability to work with multiple technologies. 

Both of the blue buttons in the professional profile page are collapsable areas with strong descriptions of my work and roles in my two places of work as a developer.
